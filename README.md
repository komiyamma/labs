# ZeppelinOS Labs

## Description

**ZeppelinOS labs** is a space for the community to interact, exchange ideas, and get involved in the development of the platform as soon as possible. **Any code here is not meant for production use.** Check out the [`zos`](https://github.com/zeppelinos/zos) repository if you are looking for using ZeppelinOS on your project.

Over time, we'll be introducing various components of the platform to our Github repo. We invite you to collaborate on how ZeppelinOS will be designed and function. To participate, you can submit thoughts, ideas, and proposals in the form of pull requests and Github issues.

## Structure

This repository holds many strategies, approaches and study cases that we are investigating and developing in favor of ZeppelinOS. Each experiment should be a project itself so we can make sure their contracts and configurations don't conflict between each other.
